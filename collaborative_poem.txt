A blanket is comforting as we work from a far.
Below are the musings from learners of R:

I rather enjoy a hot cup of tea.
Drinking it fills my heart with such glee.

The weather is nice yet I stay in and code.
Does it count if the window is open to my abode?

Studying at home is my new thing, 
Learning in R will improve my skills.
